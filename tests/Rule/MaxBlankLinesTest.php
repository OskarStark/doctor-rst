Routing is a system for mapping the URL of incoming requests to the controller
function that should be called to process the request. It both allows you
to specify beautiful URLs and keeps the functionality of your application
decoupled from those URLs. Routing is a bidirectional mechanism, meaning that it
should also be used to generate URLs.
